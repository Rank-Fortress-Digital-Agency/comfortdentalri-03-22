        <h2>Dental implants are a permanent solution for missing teeth</h2>
        <p>Missing teeth can be a source of embarrassment and can also lead to problems with eating and speaking. Dental implants are a permanent solution for missing teeth that can help to restore your smile and your confidence. Implants are made of titanium, which is biocompatible, meaning that it is safe to use in the body. The implant is placed in the jawbone where the tooth is missing, and over time it fuses with the bone to create a sturdy foundation for the replacement tooth.</p>
        <p>Dental implants can be used to replace a single tooth or multiple teeth. The implant itself is a small cylinder that is placed in the jawbone. A replacement tooth, called an abutment, is then attached to the implant. There are several types of dental implants, including crowns, bridges, and dentures. Crowns are used to replace a single missing tooth, while bridges are used to replace two or more missing teeth. Dentures are removable false teeth that are secured to implants for a more secure fit.</p>

            <p>Dental implants are a great way to replace missing teeth. They can help prevent bone loss and gum disease, too.</p>
            <p>Dental Implants are designed to last for 10-15 years or more before they need replacing again. This is accomplished by combining two different materials in the implant: titanium and zirconium oxide ceramic (or hydroxyapatite). The titanium provides the strength and structure of the replacement tooth while zirconium oxide ceramic helps with its natural appearance when it becomes exposed to the gum line over time. To create an even better-looking result, dental implants can be made from all-ceramic material or a combination of ceramics and metal alloys such as cobalt chrome, stainless steel, or pure titanium.</p>

        <hr>
        <br>
        <p>Dental implants are small devices that replace the root of a tooth. They look, feel, and function like natural teeth. A dental implant is made of titanium or stainless steel and looks like a screw with threads on the end. The implant is placed in your jawbone where it fuses to the bone as time goes by. Over time, they will fuse and create new bone tissue which replaces what was lost when your tooth was removed. This process can take anywhere from 3-6 months to fully heal but once healed you will have all the benefits of having your teeth back including chewing food better because there are no more spaces between teeth for food to get stuck in or around! Implants also help prevent gum disease because other teeth won’t move into the space left behind by a missing tooth.</p>

            <p>The process of getting dental implants usually includes cleaning your mouth and preparing the area where the implant will be placed. This is often done by a dentist, but it may also be done by an oral surgeon. The implant is then inserted into the jawbone, and over time it will fuse with the bone to create a solid foundation for the replacement tooth or teeth.</p>
            <p>Most people who get dental implants are very happy with the results. They can eat anything they want, and they no longer have to worry about their teeth falling out or becoming loose. Dental implants also look natural, and they can last for many years.</p>

      <p>Dental implants are a popular and effective way to replace missing teeth. A dental implant is a titanium post that is surgically placed in the jawbone. Once the implant has healed, a false tooth or crown is attached to the top of the implant. Dental implants are a popular and effective way to replace missing teeth. A dental implant is a titanium post that is surgically placed in the jawbone. Once the implant has healed, a false tooth or crown is attached to the top of the implant.</p>
      <p>Many people choose dental implants because they look and feel like natural teeth. Implants also help prevent bone loss in the jawbone, which can occur when teeth are missing. Dental implants are available in several different materials, including gold, titanium, and zirconium.</p>
      <p>You’ll need to make an appointment with an oral surgeon or specialist who will place the implant in your jawbone. The implant must be placed in a healthy jawbone, so you may need to have a bone graft if your jawbone is not healthy enough. Bone grafting is a surgical procedure in which healthy bone is taken from another part of your body and placed in the jawbone.</p>
